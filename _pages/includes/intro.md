# 👨‍🎓 About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at King's College London. I am fortunate to be supervised by Lecturer Lin Gui and Professor Yulan He. My research focuses on narrative understanding and reasoning in natural language processing.

I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), under the guidance of Professor Ruifeng Xu.

Besides research, I have interned at Tencent for six months and Shopee for four months, and worked at Baidu for four months as a Natural Language Processing Algorithm Engineer.
