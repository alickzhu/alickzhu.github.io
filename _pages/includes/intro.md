# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me

I am a second-year PhD student at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be supervised by Lecturer [Lin Gui](https://sites.google.com/view/lin-gui/about-me) and Professor [Yulan He](https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe). My current research focuses on Reasoning and Narrative Understanding in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science and Technology at [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Professor [Ruifeng Xu](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xuruifeng). During my master‚Äôs studies, I engaged in research focused on Stance Detection and Argument Mining.

Besides research, I have interned at Tencent Music Entertainment for eight months and Shopee for four months, and worked at Baidu for four months as a Natural Language Processing Algorithm Engineer. I am currently interning at Microsoft Research Asia.
